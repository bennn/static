%% %% abstract -- should work this into the intro
%% Memories are crucial to Nabokov. 
%% Crucial to understanding, enjoying. 
%% Yet there is more to memory in his work\textemdash a subtle layer.
%% Memory is distinctly personal.
%% Moreover, memories remain static and unchanging despite what happens to the people they concern.
%% Indeed the reality of another person\textemdash how they currently live and appear as opposed to what a character might remember them by\textemdash is often viewed as superfluous or ignored altogether.
%% People never change.

%% Nabokov's own, from \emph{Strong Opinions}
%% The bad memoirist re-touches his past, and the result is a blue-tinted or 
%% pink-shaded photograph taken by a stranger to console sentimental be- 
%% reavement. The good memoirist, on the other hand, does his best to pre- 
%% serve the utmost truth of the detail.
